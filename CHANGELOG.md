# Changelog

All notable changes to HI-DM will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- **Watch while downloading (stream mode)** — sequential single-connection
  download that writes straight to the final file, so a partially downloaded
  video can be opened and played while it is still downloading
- **Download-complete / failed notifications** — OS notifications with a
  tap-to-open action (respects the existing Notifications setting)
- **One-click Open File** — open button on finished downloads, "Open File" in
  the right-click menu, and an Open action in the detail screen
- **Queue ordering option** — choose FIFO, LIFO, largest-first, smallest-first
  or name order instead of the fixed oldest-first queue
- **Sort control on the download list** — a sort button in the toolbar (next
  to search) switches the list between oldest first, newest first, largest
  first, smallest first and name A–Z; the choice persists across restarts
- **Disk cleanup** — automatic removal of orphaned temp directories at startup
  and on delete, plus Settings → Downloads → Disk Cleanup with manual
  "orphaned temp files" and "unfinished download data" actions
- Tray/menu-bar now shows live speed, active, queued and completed counts
  while the window is closed or minimized (macOS menu bar shows the speed)
- Settings screen redesigned with sidebar navigation and card-based sections
  matching the main window's visual style
- Version in About now comes from `package_info_plus` (pubspec.yaml) so it can
  never drift from the packaged version again

### Fixed
- **Close button left a background process running** — window close is now
  intercepted, active downloads are paused and flushed, the tray is destroyed
  and the process exits cleanly (no more zombie process)
- **Downloads got stuck after a sudden close or crash** — downloads left in an
  active status with no isolate behind them are re-queued and resumed at
  startup instead of showing a frozen state
- **Downloads hung forever after network loss or laptop sleep** — stall
  watchdog detects a silent connection and retries from the bytes already on
  disk; the retry counter resets whenever progress is made, so flaky but
  alive connections keep downloading
- **Pause now takes effect immediately**, even on a stalled connection
- **Save path reset to the default on every relaunch** — a user-chosen path is
  flagged as customized and is never overwritten at startup; picking a folder
  in the Add dialog also persists it
- **Version mismatch** — pubspec bumped, About screen reads the real build via
  `package_info_plus`, and the hardcoded `AppConstants.appVersion` is now only
  a fallback
- **Corruption on resume** — a server that ignores the `Range` header now
  restarts the file instead of appending a full body to a partial file
- **Premature stream close** — a connection that ends before the segment is
  complete is retried instead of being reported as a finished download
- **Tray icon failed to load on macOS** — `tray_manager` expects a Flutter
  asset path on macOS, not an absolute file path
- Half-downloaded leftovers no longer accumulate (temp dir removed on delete,
  orphans cleaned at startup)

### Changed
- Settings tabs replaced with a sidebar + card layout consistent with the
  main window
- Analyzer is clean (4 pre-existing lint infos fixed) and the stale widget
  test was updated; suite now covers the download engine end-to-end
